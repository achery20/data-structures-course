1.	Write a short program that reads phrases from the input stream and stores each new line into an array of  C++ strings.  For each new line, the program     computes the numeric sum value of each phrase terminated with ‘\n’. For the following section of the Gettysburg Address store the numeric values of         each phrase into a int cnt[32] array.
    “Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth upon this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition         that all men are created equal. 
    Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. 
    We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave         their lives that that nation might live. 
    It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.”

2.	Two words are said to be anagrams if they contained the same characters but in different order – for instance “rescue” and “secure”.  Write a program       that takes to strings and determines if they are anagrams of each other (hint – sort both words and check if they match)
